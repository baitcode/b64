# About

Cli tool written with Golang to perform b64 encryption and decryption. Nothing special, just a tool that is supposed to work the same on Linux, Max and Windows for the sake of writing simpler instructions for the software I make. Because, you know. You can't just use base64 encoding in shell in windows.
